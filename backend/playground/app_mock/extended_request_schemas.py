"""Extended book-domain request schemas — planner-facing tools only.

Parked in playground/ — not wired into app.domains.books.schemas or the
registry, so none of this is reachable by the live planner. Every class here
is a candidate capability that was being evaluated for how parse_intent and
strategy_classification scale as the tool catalog grows (see
evals/suites/query_suite_extended.json). Docstrings are the tool
descriptions the LLM would see if wired back in, so they follow the same
"use when / not when" style as request_schemas.py — describe the
discriminating scenario in plain language rather than naming a sibling node
type, so each docstring stays readable standalone.

They also carry the same `Returns:` / `depends_on:` shape vocabulary the core
nodes use (`BookRetrievalOutput`, `BookRecommendationOutput`,
`AnalyzeBooksOutput`, `ActionConfirmationOutput`) — defined in
app/domains/books/schemas/output_schemas.py. Two nodes here sit outside it on
purpose: Retrieve_Author_Info returns prose about a person and
Retrieve_Reading_Stats returns counts, so neither can feed a node that depends
on books. Retrieve_Reading_List does produce books and is the node to reach for
when a plan needs what the user has already read.
