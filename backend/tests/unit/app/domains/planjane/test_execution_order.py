"""Tests for PlanJaneOutput.execution_order — the dependency layering.

`TaskRunnerWorkflow` runs the layers flattened, so today only the flattened
order has to be a valid topological order. The layering is asserted anyway
because layers are the parallelization seam: the moment a layer is run with
`asyncio.gather`, a goal sharing a layer with its own dependency becomes a
race. The previous implementation produced exactly that.
