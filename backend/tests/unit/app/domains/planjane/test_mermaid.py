"""Tests for planjane/dial/mermaid.py — goals turned into diagram boxes.

Scoped to what this layer decides: which field heads a box, which fields earn
a row, and the `depends_on` → `sent_to` inversion. Markup, orientation and
emission belong to dial/format.py and are tested in test_mermaid_format.py.

The node types below are arbitrary — any *registered* one works, and the
renderer never asks what a node does. They have to be registered only because
`SystemGoal.target_node_type` is a `NodeTypeEnum`, so parking a node breaks
every test naming it.
