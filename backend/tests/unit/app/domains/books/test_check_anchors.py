"""The similarity node's two refusals, checked before it fetches anything.

`check_anchors` is where the node decides it cannot answer, and both refusals
are contracts rather than implementation details: nothing to be similar to, and
too many books to fold into one description. They are checked off
`ParsedDependents.total()`, which costs no round trip, so the refusal happens
before the anchor is materialized rather than after.

No store and no LLM here — the method reads a dataclass and raises. It is a
method rather than a pure function only because the piles are worth recording
even when they do not stop the run, which is what the last test pins.
