"""The numeric node's pure half — the bounds as the sentence the user reads.

No workflow, no store, no LLM: a parsed `BookMetadataFilter` goes in, the line
that reaches the chat comes out. Worth pinning because it is the only place the
node explains itself — a count with no phrase beside it is a number the user
cannot check.
