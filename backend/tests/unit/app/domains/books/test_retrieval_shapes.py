"""Which half of the retrieval split each registered node produces.

`BookAnchorOutput` and `BookCandidateOutput` add no fields, so there is nothing
to test *on* them — the type is the payload, and what these assert is that
`build_input` selects on it. The point of the split is that a node depending on
anchors cannot be handed a subject search: the refusal happens at dispatch,
naming the field, instead of inside the node after two round trips.

`SimilarBooksInput` is the shipped consumer, so the selection tests drive the
real class rather than a stand-in. The parenting assertions are the ones that
fail loudly if a slice is reparented by accident.
