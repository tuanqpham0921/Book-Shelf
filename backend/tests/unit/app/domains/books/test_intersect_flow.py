"""The intersect node's flow, with the two round trips faked.

The node has no parse, so there is less between its input and its output than
any other slice — which is exactly why the flow is worth pinning: everything it
does is decided by what it was handed, and a wrong read of the anchors is the
only way it can be wrong.

What is faked is the boundary and nothing inside it: `store.count` and
`store.materialize`. The executor, the `@task` envelopes, the real `compose`
and `finalize_result` are all real, so the SQL asserted below is the SQL that
would run.
