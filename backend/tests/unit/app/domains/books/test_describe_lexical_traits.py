"""Tests for `describe_lexical_traits` — the subject as the line the user reads.

The string is read twice by the user (the loading message and the count line)
and never by anything else, so what is covered here is that it reads as English
and that an empty parse renders falsy — the executor branches on exactly that to
refuse a goal it was wrongly handed.
