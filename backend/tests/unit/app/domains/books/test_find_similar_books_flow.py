"""The similarity node's flow, end to end with the two round trips faked.

The other slices have no flow test because there is nothing between their parse
and their count. This one has four steps that hand values to each other —
anchors → rows → a description → a pool — and only the last of them reaches the
output the task runner reads, so a step wired to the wrong variable would pass
every other test in this directory.

What is faked is the boundary and nothing inside it: `store.materialize` (awaited
**twice** — once for the anchor rows, once for the preview) and
`store.score_stats` for the round trips, `run_llm_args_parse` and
`get_embeddings` for the LLM. The executor, the `@task` envelopes, the anchor
pooling, the real `embedding_search_stmt` and `finalize_result` are all real.
