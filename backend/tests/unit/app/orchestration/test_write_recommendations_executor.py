"""Tests for write_recommendations/executor.py — the reply stage's flow.

The stage no longer fetches (2026-09-11): every book node keeps the preview it
streamed on its output, and the runner hands each goal over as a `TaskResult`.
So what is asserted here is what the stage does with those — what it tells the
writer, and which cards follow which text — against a faked LLM call.

Since it was deregistered (2026-09-08) it takes one undifferentiated
`results` list rather than a `sources`/`failures` split assembled by
`build_input`, so `_input` below is what does the partitioning in reverse.
