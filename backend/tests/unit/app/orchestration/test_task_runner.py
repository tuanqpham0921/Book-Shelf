"""Tests for TaskRunnerWorkflow — plan execution and its UI bracketing.

The runner is the one place a goal turns into a running executor, and it is
also the sole owner of the `task.start` / `task.end` pairing the frontend
renders task sections from. Both are asserted here on the events actually
streamed, not on internal calls: an unpaired section is a UI bug that correct
bookkeeping would not catch.

Specs are built with `dataclasses.replace` off the real `find_by_title.SPEC`
rather than hand-rolled — `NodeSpec.__post_init__` checks the node_type against
the request schema's Literal default, so a fabricated request class is rejected
before the test starts.
