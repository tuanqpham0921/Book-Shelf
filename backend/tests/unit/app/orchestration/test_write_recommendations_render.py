"""Tests for write_recommendations/render.py — the plan as the writer sees it.

Pure functions with no database and no LLM, which is the point of the satellite
module: what the reply is allowed to know is decided here, and it is checkable
without running anything.

The load-bearing assertions are about *absence*. A reply that names an ISBN, or
that reports a failed goal as an empty catalog, is wrong in a way no downstream
check would catch — the prose would read perfectly well.
