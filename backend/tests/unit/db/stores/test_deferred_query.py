"""Tests for `DeferredBookQuery` and the module-level query builders.

Two things are covered. First, regression coverage for the SQL-injection fix:
`text(f"'{value}'")` used to splice user-controlled strings directly into the
query, so a value like `' OR 1=1 --` broke out of the string literal.
func.similarity() must receive the raw Python string and let SQLAlchemy bind it
as a parameter.

Second, the deferred family's invariants — the ones that make a query
composable into a WITH clause instead of runnable on its own — and, since
2026-08-24, the one query that trades them away
(`TestTheVectorQueryException`). The statements
are derived on `DeferredBookQuery` itself (`count_stmt` / `score_stats_stmt` /
`materialize_stmt` / `compose`), so everything here compiles SQL with no session
in sight.

`TestScoredIntersect` covers what `Combine_Intersect` builds, and replaced
`TestFilterQuery` when `filter_query` was deleted the same day: a
bound now reaches an intersection as its own deferred query rather than as a
`BookMetadataFilter` a filter node parsed.
