"""Tests for `BookStore.lexical_query` and the two pure helpers behind it.

Three things are covered, and the first is the one with no other guard.

**The index-match guard.** `books_search_idx` is a GIN index over an *expression*,
and Postgres matches those structurally, on constant-folded nodes. A Python
string handed to `func.to_tsvector` becomes a bind parameter, a `Param` is not a
`Const`, and the index silently stops being used — the query drops from ~5ms back
to the ~520ms sequential scan with nothing failing. `literal_column` is what
prevents that, and the assertions here are what stop someone "simplifying" it
back.

**The drift guard.** The same expression is written twice, once in
`search_document()` and once as DDL in `db/init/02_indexes.sql`. They must stay
character-identical for the same reason, so the test compares them.

**The deferred invariants and the score contract** — no LIMIT, no ORDER BY, and a
`score` column only when there is a degree of match to rank by.

Everything compiles SQL with no session in sight.
