"""What `embedding_search_stmt` puts into its one statement.

It returns a `DeferredBookQuery` like the other builders, with one exception:
it keeps its LIMIT, because `materialize_stmt` can reproduce its order (it
sorts by `score`) but not its truncation. That exception is carried by the SQL
alone, since nothing on `DeferredBookQuery` marks it.

That is what most of this file guards. The similarity floor and the
exclusions have to be *in* the statement: the search orders the whole table
and truncates, so anything cut afterwards is cut from an already-truncated
set. The shape of what comes back matters too — isbn13
plus a column named exactly `score`, which is what `compose(op="and")` carries and
`materialize_stmt` orders by, and therefore what lets a downstream bound narrow
a similarity pool without flattening its ranking.

Pure builder, so no session, no store, no mock. Only the WHERE clause is
inspected where narrowing is the subject — the select list names every column, so
a bare column name proves nothing about narrowing.
