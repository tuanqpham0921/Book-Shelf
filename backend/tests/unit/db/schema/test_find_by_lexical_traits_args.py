"""What `FindByLexicalTraitsArgs` refuses, and the vocabulary it is built on.

The keyword cap is the one rule with teeth. Keywords are ANDed in SQL, so each
one narrows the search: a parse that emits six of them finds nothing and reads
as a broken node rather than as a bad parse. `max_length` makes "few high-signal
keywords" structural instead of leaving it to the prompt alone.
