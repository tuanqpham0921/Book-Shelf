"""The one ContextVar: which envelope is currently being built.

A child cannot know its caller, so the caller publishes its envelope for the
duration of the call and the callee adopts itself on the way out. `record_span`
(span.py) is the only user, which is what `@task` and `Workflow.__call__` both
wrap their call in.

A plain `await` shares the caller's context; `gather`/`create_task` copy it
(shallowly, so attaches still mutate the real record). Fire-and-forget
outliving its parent attaches to an already-serialized envelope — await
background work inside the scope that owns it.
