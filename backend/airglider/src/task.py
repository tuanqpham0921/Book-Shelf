    Reach for `Workflow` when you want a declared output type, SSE helpers, or
    somewhere to hang state — that is the whole difference. A task publishes its
    own envelope while it runs, so it may call other tasks and workflows freely,
    and `(await step).unwrap()` aborts it on a failed step exactly as it would a
    workflow.

    `description` is a short, reader-facing line for the envelope —
    `@task(description="Count matching books")`; a bare `@task` gets the
    generic one.
