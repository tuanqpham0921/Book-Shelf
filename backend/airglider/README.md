# airglider

Result envelopes and workflow scaffolding for async pipelines: every step
returns the same envelope, nothing crashes silently, and a finished run is one
tree you can persist, summarize, and cost.

## Use it

```python
from airglider import OperationResult, Workflow, task
```

`airglider/__init__.py` is the entire public surface. **Import from the package
root, never from `airglider.src.*`** — the internal layout is deliberately free
to move. A symbol that is not re-exported in `__init__.py` is not API.

| Import | What it is |
|---|---|
| `Workflow` | base class for a multi-step async process — subclass, override `run()` |
| `task` | decorator for a single async function |
| `StepFailure` | control-flow signal raised by `OperationResult.unwrap` when a step fails |
| `OperationResult` | the one envelope: `ok`, `description`, `input`, `details`, `runtime_error`, `timing`, `token_usage`, `parent_id`, `steps` — plus `add_step` / `unwrap` / `flatten` / `to_span` |
| `parent_scope`, `current_parent`, `add_details` | the nesting ContextVar, and writing to the envelope currently running (see below) |
| `Response`, `Time` | the envelope's payload and timing sub-models |
| `TokenUsage`, `ModelUsage` | token counts, per-model split, and USD cost |
| `RuntimeErrorInfo` | serializable exception record |
| `cost_of`, `MODEL_PRICES`, `PRICES_CHECKED_ON`, … | the price table (see below) |
| `to_serializable`, `remove_empty_values`, `strip_zero_token_usage`, `now_iso`, `uuid_8` | serialization + identity helpers |

## The rules

The contract, as implemented. Everything after this section is the reasoning
behind one or another of these.

### What you are in, and what you get back

1. **Instrumentation is opt-in, and it is what puts you in the tree.** A `@task`
   or a `Workflow` gets an envelope, a parent, timing and a spot in `steps`. A
   plain `async def` gets none of that — it is an ordinary call. Nothing is
   wrong with that; instrument what you want to be able to read later.
2. **An uninstrumented callee that raises fails its caller.** With no envelope of
   its own, the exception travels to the nearest enclosing `@task`/`Workflow`,
   where it is stamped as *that* unit's `runtime_error`. So the trace says the
   caller failed and names the exception, but shows no step for where it
   happened. That is the cost of not instrumenting, and the reason to.
3. **Calling one always returns an envelope; it does not raise.** `record_span`
   swallows `Exception` — the envelope's `ok`/`runtime_error` *is* the report,
   which is what keeps a failed unit from crashing the one above it.
   `asyncio.CancelledError` is the exception: stamped, then re-raised, because
   swallowing it would stop the actual cancellation.
4. **A `@task` returns its payload — the envelope is the decorator's.**
   Returning an `OperationResult` raises `TypeError`. Use
   `(await step).unwrap()` to pass a nested step's payload through, `await step`
   to inspect it, `add_details(...)` to annotate.
5. **`Workflow` vs `@task` is scaffolding, not permission.** A workflow gives you
   a declared output type, a class to hang state on, and (in this app) SSE
   helpers. Either may call either, in any nesting; the tree comes out right
   without anything threaded through a signature.

### Who says what about `ok`

6. **`ok` means "ran to completion".** It is not a content judgment. A query that
   matched nothing, a planner that produced zero goals, a filter that removed
   everything — all `ok=True`. They did what their input asked.
7. **The producer judges completeness; the consumer judges sufficiency.** "Did I
   fill in what I promised, given the input I got?" is the producer's question.
   "Is what I got enough for what I am doing?" is the consumer's, and it is
   answered by reading the payload — never by asking the producer to have
   encoded it in `ok`.
8. **A producer that cannot complete raises.** It does not set `ok=False` and
   return a payload-less envelope. Raising is what puts the reason in
   `runtime_error`; setting the flag by hand leaves the consumer stopped with
   nothing underneath explaining why.
9. **Therefore `ok=False` ⟺ `runtime_error is not None`.** `unwrap` still handles
   the other combination, and says so in the message — see the gap below.

### Running a step

10. **Two verbs, and there is no third.** `await step` hands back the envelope
    and leaves the policy to the caller. `(await step).unwrap()` hands back the
    payload or stops. Splitting the await from the policy is what lets a caller
    retry an envelope, or inspect it and *then* insist.

    ```python
    books = (await self.store_lookup(isbn)).unwrap()   # can't continue without it

    step = await planner(NodeInput(query=q))           # a failure here means
    if not step.ok:                                    # something specific to
        await self.send_message("I couldn't plan that") # this caller
    ```

11. **`unwrap` on a failed step notes it upward, then raises `StepFailure`.** The
    note (`FAILED STEP: <name>`) lands on whatever envelope is currently being
    built, so the stopped caller records which step stopped it.
12. **A `StepFailure` stops exactly one unit of work.** `record_span` catches it,
    stamps `runtime_error`, and logs one warning line — no traceback, since the
    step that actually crashed already logged the real one. It does **not**
    escape to the caller above. Aborting several levels means each level
    unwrapping in turn, which is a decision per level rather than an exception
    tearing through units that might have wanted to handle it.
13. **You never attach a step by hand.** Nesting is automatic. `add_step` exists
    for the one case it cannot cover — an envelope produced outside any scope,
    as when a non-workflow caller builds a root over finished records — and is
    idempotent, so calling it anyway is absorbed rather than double-billed.

### Writing to your own envelope

14. **`add_details(...)` writes to the unit of work currently running**, which
    inside a `@task` body is that task's own record. `current_parent()` is the
    same lookup if you need the envelope itself (to stamp `token_usage`, say).
15. **`self.add_details` on a `Workflow` always means that workflow.** So in a
    `@task` *method* on a workflow the two land in different places: the module
    function on the task, `self.` on the workflow. Usually you want the former.
16. **A payload carrying `token_usage` has it promoted.** When a `@task`'s
    return value has a `token_usage: TokenUsage` attribute, the decorator
    moves it onto the task's envelope (`+=`, so it aggregates by model) and
    sets the payload's copy to `None`. This is how a client call's spend
    enters the tree without the client knowing about envelopes — the host's
    `AssistantMessage` and `EmbeddingsResult` both ride it. Type the field
    `TokenUsage | None`, since the decorator will null it.
17. **`description` is the envelope's one reader-facing line** — what the step
    does, for a UI rather than a developer. A `Workflow` subclass sets the
    class attribute (`description = "Finds books by title"`), a task passes it
    to the decorator (`@task(description="Counts matching books")`); left
    unset, they read `"Workflow class"` and `"@task function"`. Not taken from
    the docstring: those are written for whoever edits the code.

### Known gap

`Workflow.__call__` does not yet set `ok=True` on clean completion — a `run()`
body has to set `self.record.ok = True` itself (this app does it in
`AppWorkflow.finalize_result`). So rule 9 is a convention today rather than
something the library enforces, and rule 8 is the one to hold the line on
until the default flips.

## The record tree, and `flatten()`

**One envelope class.** `OperationResult` is a unit of work — id, parent,
timing, input, output, details, usage, error — and the `steps` it accumulated.
A `Workflow` and a `@task` produce the same thing; one that ran nothing else
just carries an empty `steps`.

There used to be a `WorkFlowOperationResult` subclass that added `steps`, on the
reasoning that a leaf has no children and should not carry the field. Two things
retired it. `steps` is not mandatory — an empty list costs nothing and `flatten`
reads it the same either way — and, more decisively, once nesting became
automatic (below) any unit of work can run another, so "which shape am I"
stopped being answerable at decoration time. What the split actually produced
was the same relationship rebuilt from several angles: an isinstance ladder in
`flatten`, a `getattr(x, "steps", [])` at every reader, and a rule about who was
allowed to call whom.

`add_step` is the only place parentage is known, so it is the only place
`parent_id` is set, and stamping on attach rather than deriving it later is what
carries the link through serialization. It is **idempotent**: a step that
already has a `parent_id` is skipped, and one claimed by a *different* parent is
refused and logged, since the same envelope in two trees would have its spend
counted in both.

## Nesting — the one ContextVar

A child cannot know its own parent: a `@task` is a plain async function with no
reference to its caller, and a `Workflow` is constructed before anyone decides
where its record hangs. So the *caller* publishes instead. `parent_scope(record)`
(`src/context.py`) sets `CURRENT_PARENT`, and in its `finally` resets it and then
attaches `record` to whatever was current before. `@task`'s wrapper and
`Workflow.__call__` are the only two call sites, which keeps the set/reset
discipline checkable by reading two files.

What follows from it:

- **Who calls whom stopped mattering.** A task may call a task, a workflow, or
  any mix; nothing is threaded through a signature and the tree still comes out
  right.
- **Two verbs for running a step**, since attaching is no longer anybody's job:
  `await step` hands back the envelope and leaves the caller to decide what a
  failure means; `(await step).unwrap()` hands back the payload or raises
  `StepFailure`. Splitting the await from the policy is what lets a caller retry
  an envelope, or inspect it and *then* insist. Both work inside a `@task` as
  well as a `Workflow` — `record_span` owns the `StepFailure` stop path, so
  either records and logs an abort the same way. (`add_step` remains, for the
  one case nesting can't cover: an envelope produced outside any scope.)
- **Attaching happens on the way out**, which the token rollup requires:
  `add_step` reads a child's usage once, at attach time, so a record attached
  before it ran would contribute zero to every ancestor. The cancel path comes
  free — `finally` runs while `CancelledError` propagates, so a step killed by a
  client disconnect still lands in its parent's `steps`.
- **Concurrency is safe.** A plain `await` shares the caller's context;
  `gather`/`create_task` copy it, so siblings each keep their own parent. The
  copy is shallow, so the attach still mutates the real record.
- **Fire-and-forget stays broken**, and cannot be fixed here: a `create_task`
  that outlives its parent attaches to an envelope already serialized and
  reported. Await background work inside the scope that owns it.

**A `@task` returns its payload; the envelope is the decorator's.** Returning an
`OperationResult` raises `TypeError`. The shape used to mean "report `ok` myself
without raising" or "hand back what I called", and both have better answers now
— `ok` means ran-to-completion, and anything awaited inside already attached
itself. Use `(await step).unwrap()` to pass a nested step's payload through,
`await step` to inspect it, and `add_details(...)` to write free text onto the
envelope currently running (inside a `@task` body, that is the task's own
record).

`flatten()` is then the tree as a **span list** — depth-first, parent before
child, each entry carrying its `parent_id` and (via `Time.end_time`) its own
interval. The nesting is rebuildable from the list alone, with no reference to
the tree, which is what a timeline or a per-step cost table wants. `to_summary()`
remains the shape for *reading* a run top to bottom.

No row drags a subtree, so the list does not re-encode the tree once per level:
every node goes through `to_span()` on the way in, which returns a shallow copy
carrying `steps=[]`. A node with no children has nothing to drop and comes back
**by reference**, which keeps flattening a mostly-free walk. `to_span()` is
`model_construct` over the shared fields rather than a dump-and-revalidate, so a
live payload stays the object the executor produced — and the sub-models are
shared with the tree node, making a span a view rather than an independent
record.

A record reloaded from JSON is the case to know about: `steps` is typed
`list[Any]` on purpose — pydantic would otherwise re-validate a child on
assignment and hand back a *copy*, breaking the one thing the tree depends on,
a step being the same object the workflow that produced it is still writing to.
The cost is plain-dict children after a round trip, which `flatten` validates on
the way past.

## `record.input` — what a unit of work was called with

Both `Workflow.__call__` and `@task` stamp it **before** the call, so a crashed
or cancelled step still records its arguments. Keyed by parameter name, so
`f(x)` and `f(arg=x)` record identically; a leading `self`/`cls` is dropped,
since the receiver of a decorated method is not an argument.

Values go through `to_record_input`, which differs from `to_serializable` in
the one way a *call record* needs: **the result is always JSON-encodable.**
Arguments are not payloads a caller chose to record — they are whatever the
function happens to take, and a live DB session or client reaching the
envelope would break the host's insert far from where it came from.

A value is **recorded whole** whenever it serializes. Only one that does not
falls back, first to its own `to_summary()` (the host's built queries offer
one, so a step that took a query shows its SQL rather than a type name), and
past that to `<TypeName>`. The cost of whole values: a step's input is often
the step before it's output, already recorded on its own envelope, so the full
record repeats it once per dependent. Compact reading is `to_summary()` on the
envelope, not here.

Neither path raises: `to_summary` is host code this library does not control,
and bookkeeping that can take down the run it describes is a worse trade than
a missing field.

## The invariant

**airglider imports nothing from the host application.** That is what makes it
liftable into its own distribution, and it is the thing to protect when editing.
It is why the serialization helpers and the price table live in here rather than
being borrowed from the app's `common/`/`config/`.

To check the invariant still holds, import it with the host packages blocked:

```bash
poetry run python -c "
import sys
class B:
    def find_module(self, name, path=None):
        return self if name.split('.')[0] in {'app','common','config','clients','db','evals'} else None
    def load_module(self, name): raise ImportError(name)
sys.meta_path.insert(0, B()); import airglider; print('ok')"
```

The host's `common/utils` **re-exports** the helpers rather than keeping a second
copy, so `from common.utils import to_serializable` and `from airglider import
to_serializable` are the same function and cannot drift.

## Mermaid is not in here

It briefly was. It now lives at `app/domains/planjane/dial/`, because PlanJane
is the only thing that draws a diagram and is headed for being a service of its
own — the renderer has to travel with it. `dial/format.py` still imports
nothing but `airglider`, so nothing about that move loosened this package.

## Pricing is the one piece of policy

`src/config.py` holds a snapshot of one provider's prices on one date. Counting
and rolling up tokens is general; *what a token costs* is not. It lives inside
the package so `TokenUsage` can stamp `cost_usd` with no wiring from the host —
the tradeoff being that a host calling other providers has to edit that file.
If that becomes the norm, the seam to cut is `cost_of`: inject it instead of
importing it, and the module moves back out to the application.

Rates go stale. Re-verify and bump `PRICES_CHECKED_ON`. A model with no entry
lands in `unpriced_models` and contributes nothing to `cost_usd` — unknown
spend, deliberately not silent zero spend.

## Tests

```bash
make tests-airglider      # or: poetry run pytest airglider/tests/
```

They live beside the source so they travel with the package, and import only
from `airglider`. `tests/__init__.py` is what keeps their module names
namespaced against same-named files elsewhere in the host repo.

## Before extracting it

Known rough edges, in rough priority order:

1. **`src/` is nested inside the package**, so internal paths read
   `airglider.src.schemas.record`. The convention is `src/airglider/…` at repo
   root, or no `src` layer at all.
2. **`base_glider.py` contains `Workflow`** — the module is named for the
   metaphor, the class for the concept. Pick one axis.
3. **`record.py` holds `OperationResult`, and callers store it as `.record`** —
   three names for one thing (record / OperationResult / "envelope"). Cheapest
   to unify now, while the library has one consumer.
4. `exception.py` → `exceptions.py`; `schemas/` is a web-app word for what is
   really the core model.
5. Needs its own `pyproject.toml` and pytest config — the suite currently
   inherits `asyncio_mode = "auto"` from the host's.
