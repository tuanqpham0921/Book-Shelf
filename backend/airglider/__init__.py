"""airglider — result envelopes and workflow scaffolding for async pipelines.

Everything a consumer needs is re-exported here, so application code imports
`from airglider import ...` and never reaches into `airglider.src.*`. That
indirection is the whole point of the package boundary: the internal module
layout stays free to move without touching a caller.

The package imports nothing from its host application, so it can be lifted out
as a standalone distribution. The one thing a host is expected to edit is the
model price table in `airglider.src.config` — see that module's docstring.
