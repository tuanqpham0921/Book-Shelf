"""`Time.end_time` — derived from `start_time + duration`, never observed.

The derivation only means anything if `start_time` is the instant `duration`
is measured from. Both `Workflow.__call__` and `@task` have to stamp it
themselves to make that true, and for opposite reasons: a workflow's envelope
is built at *construction* (before the runner dispatches it), while a task's is
built *after* the await (so the default would record the finish as the start,
putting the whole interval a duration too late). Those two are the real tests
here — the property itself is arithmetic.
