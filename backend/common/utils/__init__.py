"""Shared utility surface for the app.

The identity and serialization helpers live in `airglider` — they are what
its record tree is built and persisted with, so the library owns them rather
than borrowing them from here. They are re-exported (not re-implemented) so
app code keeps importing them from one place and the two can never drift.
