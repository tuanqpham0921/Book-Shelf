    Ranges are inclusive on both ends, and each bound is independent — supply one,
    the other, or both.

    **The field descriptions carry the calibration for vague language**, and that
    is the reason they are so wordy. "Well rated", "popular", "a quick read",
    "the classical period" are all real asks that have to become a number
    somewhere, and this model is what every tool schema taking bounds ships.
    Today that is one schema — `FindByNumericTraitsArgs.traits` — but it was two
    until 2026-08-24 (`FilterRetrievalArgs.filters` went with its node), and the
    calibration stays here rather than in that slice's docstring for the same
    reason it was put here: a second parser of bounds must not be able to
    calibrate "well rated" differently.

    Each description leads with the value to use and mentions the corpus range
    only where it stops a mistake. That order is load-bearing: an earlier draft
    opened with "Corpus range is 1876-2019" and `gpt-5-nano` answered "the
    classical period" with `max_year: 1876` — it took the nearest number in the
    sentence rather than the calibrated one.

    The thresholds are prompt text tuned against this corpus, not application
    limits — nothing in code reads them back, so they stay literal here rather
    than moving to `config/constants.py`. Only the corpus *ranges* come from
    `BookConstraints`. Retune them against the real distribution, not intuition:
    the counts quoted below are from the 5,197-book catalog as of 2026-08-20.

    Whether bounds are the *subject* of a search or a narrowing of one is a
    question about plans, not about this model. Since 2026-08-24 the answer is
    "always the subject": `FindByNumericTraitsRetrieval` searches on them, and a
    bound that narrows something else is that same search intersected with the
    subject's by `Combine_Intersect`.
