    `DeferredBookQuery` gets recorded by `count_books` after the fact; this one

    **and cosine order survives it**. That is what makes "books like Dune under
    300 pages" expressible as two nodes rather than needing bounds parsed in

    Two narrowings, both landing inside the statement because anything applied

    - `similarity_threshold` is the floor. Without it this returns the top
      `limit` rows however far away they are — the whole table, ordered and
      truncated — so an ask with no near match answers with strangers.
    - `exclude_isbns` drops the books the ask already named. In SQL rather than
      in the caller, so the excluded rows do not eat `limit` slots.

    `limit` is required rather than defaulted: there is one caller, it always
    passes `CANDIDATE_POOL_SIZE`, and a second number here would be the one
    read when the constant changed.
