"""A book query that has been built but not executed for rows.

Retrieval nodes hand one of these downstream instead of a book list: the node
runs only a COUNT, and whichever node is last in the plan turns the query into
rows. See docs/design/execution-pipeline-v1.md.

Everything that can be *derived* from a built query lives here as a method —
the counting statement, the materializing statement, pooling several into one —
so the store's job is reduced to the two things a derivation can't do: build a
query from a search dimension (that needs the model) and execute a statement
(that needs the session).

class DeferredBookQuery:
    """Wraps a SELECT of isbn13 (plus an optional `score` column).

    Two invariants are what make these composable into a single WITH clause:
    **no LIMIT and no ORDER BY**. Both belong to the step that materializes,
    because a limit applied per-dimension would silently shrink whatever a
    later composition can find.

    **One query takes a documented exception**: the vector search
    (`embedding_search_stmt`). It does not select a subset — it orders the
    whole table by cosine distance and truncates — so its LIMIT is not a shrunk
    view of a set, it *is* the set. `materialize_stmt` can reproduce a ranking
    (it orders by `score`), but not a ranking-truncation, so the truncation has
    to happen where the ranking does. Everything else still holds for it:
    isbn13 plus a `score`, so `compose(op="and")` narrows it and keeps cosine
    order, and `count_stmt`/`materialize_stmt` work unchanged.

    **Nothing on this class marks that exception, and `compose()` does not
    refuse it.** A tracked `capped` attribute and a guard on composition were
    both tried and removed on 2026-08-24. What that left unprotected has since
    split in two (2026-08-24, `Combine_Intersect`):

    - **`"and"` is as safe as a narrowing ever was.** The LIMIT applies before
      the membership test, so the count means "of the 250 nearest, N also
      match" rather than "N in the catalog" — the same lossiness a metadata
      bound on a pool always had, and the caller's to phrase. The ranking now
      survives it, which is the whole point of the score column.
    - **`"or"` is still wrong and still unguarded.** The LIMIT applies before
      the union, so it changes which books qualify, and 250 of ~1,200 similar
      books pooled with all 358 lexical matches over-weights the lexical branch.
      Nothing registered reaches it: `Combine_Union` does not exist. Before it
      does, tune the similarity floor so the pool needs no LIMIT — which
      dissolves the exception rather than policing it — or restore the guard.
      See docs/design/execution-pipeline-v1.md.
