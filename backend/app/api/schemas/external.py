class BookOut(BaseModel):
    """One book as the chat client receives it, in a `book_card` SSE event.

    The wire contract for a book, and the only place the frontend's field
    names are pinned on this side. `Book` (app/domains/books/schemas.py) is the
    internal model and carries every catalog column; this is the subset the UI
    renders — `BookCard`, `BookCardDetailed`, `BookCover` and `BookDetailModal`
    between them read exactly these fields and nothing else.

    Unlike the prompt-facing renderers, which pick their fields inline, the
    narrowing here is a *type* on purpose: serialization is the boundary, so a
    field added to `Book` reaches the browser unless something stops it, and
    this class is that something. `ratings_count` is the standing example — the
    bounds behind "obscure" and "most popular" are read off it and it is worth
    keeping in the run log, but no card renders it. (`similarity_score` used to
    be the example; it was deleted 2026-08-24, when the similarity node stopped
    carrying rows to attach it to.)

    Adding or renaming a field here is a frontend change: the components read
    these names straight off the event payload, so a rename breaks rendering
    silently, with no error raised on either side.
