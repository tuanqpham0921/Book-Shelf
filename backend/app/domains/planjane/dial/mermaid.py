"""Goals → `MermaidBox`es. The drawing itself is `dial/format.py`.

This module decides only what a box *says*; `get_diagram` owns markup,
orientation and emission, which is what keeps the renderer free of app types.

PlanJane owns the whole mermaid stack — the diagram *is* the plan rendered, so a
caller that drew it would be doing the planner's job, and it has to travel with
PlanJane when that becomes its own service.

The `depends_on` → `sent_to` inversion happens here, once, so no call site can
get the arrow backwards.
