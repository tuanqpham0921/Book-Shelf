"""What PlanJane exposes to the layers around it: the plan, the goal it is made
of, and the order those goals run in.

`schemas.py` is what the *LLM* fills in; this is what the rest of the app reads
back. `SystemGoal` sits here rather than there because it is both — the planner
LLM emits it as a nested tool schema, and then it travels: the task runner
dispatches one per node, triage layers them, `run_recorder` serializes them. A
consumer importing it should not have to reach through the tool schema that
produced it, and `executor.py` should not be the address for a payload.

Imports `schemas.py` for nothing — the dependency runs the other way
(`GoalParseRequest.system_goals` is a `list[SystemGoal]`), which is what keeps
this module importable without pulling in the planner's prompt example.

    """Purpose: One parsed goal from the user's message — a capability the
    system should attempt, with the confidence that it maps cleanly to a
    supported node type. One entry in GoalParseRequest.system_goals.

    Args:
        id: A short id for this goal, in the form '1', '2', ... — other
            goals reference it through their depends_on.
        instruction: What this node is to do, written to the node. It sees
            only this line and the typed outputs of the goals it depends on —
            never the user's message — so it must be self-contained: carry
            every literal the node needs (titles, author names, numbers,
            bounds) as the user wrote them, carry no work belonging to another
            goal, and drop the parts of the message this node is not for.
        generation_instruction: What this goal is to *say* back to the user,
            or null — which is what almost every goal carries. Set it when the
            message asks a step to report in words rather than in book cards
            ("do you have Dune?" → "Confirm whether Dune is in the catalogue"),
            or to steer what an analyze goal's reply covers. It is the ask for
            prose, never the prose: null does not silence a node that writes a
            reply anyway.
        confidence: How confident the system is that it can fulfill this goal.
        reasoning: A short justification for choosing this goal (up to 100
            characters).
        target_node_type: The single capability name from the catalog that
            fulfills this goal.
        depends_on: Ids of the goals that must complete before this one;
            an empty list when it depends on nothing.

    Returns: One candidate goal that the argument parser later fills in with
    typed arguments, or refuses.

    Constraints: exactly one target_node_type per goal — a multi-part
    request becomes separate goals, not one goal with multiple types.
