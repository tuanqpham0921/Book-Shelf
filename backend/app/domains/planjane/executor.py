"""The planner's flow. `run` is the table of contents; everything else sits
where the flow reaches it.

Same reading rule as the book slices (domains/README.md;
`books/find_similar_books/executor.py` is the worked example): this file is the
flow — `run()` plus every step, methods in the order `run` reaches them — with
the request builder as a module-level pure function beside it. The satellites
hold what outlives the run: `schemas.py` is what the LLM fills in,
`external.py` is what the plan *is*, `dial/` is how the plan is shown.
