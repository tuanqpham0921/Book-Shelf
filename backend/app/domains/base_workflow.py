"""`AppWorkflow` — the base class behind every unit of work in the app.

Pins one call shape, `run(node_input)`, where `node_input` is the workflow's own
`WorkflowInput` subclass. The input is assembled and validated by whoever
dispatches (`build_input`), so a missing dependency is one validation at the
boundary rather than a guard in every node body.

Services are not constructor arguments and not on the input — they are
properties off `RequestContext`. Context and input split on lifetime: services
per request, an input per dispatch.

Declare the output in the class header (`AppWorkflow[FindByTitleOutput]`); it is
resolved from the generic parameter, so a subclass needs no `__init__`.

Domain-specific behaviour belongs in that domain's own base (`BookWorkflow`),
which is what keeps this module free of book models and wire schemas. Building
LLM requests is likewise a slice's job, so one node can use a different model or
prompt without a flag on a base class.
