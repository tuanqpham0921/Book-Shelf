"""The intersect node's flow — the single-call shape with the call removed.

Four files like `find_by_title/`, minus the parse: this node reads nothing out
of its goal text, so there is no `*Args` schema, no `build_arg_parser_request`
and no `args` field. It is the one node in the app that makes no LLM call at
all — what it does is decided entirely by which goals it depends on, which is
`build_input`'s job rather than a parse's.

What is left is the counts-first move over a composed query: read the upstream
queries, AND them, count, preview, finalize. Reading them stays a module-level
function here rather than a `dependents.py`: there is one thing to pull out of
an anchor, which has not outgrown `run`.
