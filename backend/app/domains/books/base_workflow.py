"""What every book node's executor shares — the books layer of the base class.

`AppWorkflow` pins the call signature for any unit of work; this adds what only
a book node needs: `store` (the request-scoped book store, already resolved when
the runner narrowed the context), the two halves of the counts-first opening
move — `count_books()` and `fetch_books()`, see
docs/design/execution-pipeline-v1.md — and `stream_books()`.

**Counting and fetching are separate calls, and only one of them writes to the
output.** They used to be a single `preflight()` returning `(total, sample)`
from one `BookStore.preview` round trip, which made the sample look like part of
the node's result no matter where it was assigned. Split, the default is a node
that counts and hands on a query; fetching rows is a second, visible decision at
the call site, and costs a second round trip when a node really wants both.

**What the two share is deliberately small.** A node that needs something more
than "count this" or "fetch rows off this" composes it out of them in its own
flow rather than growing a third method here — `find_similar_books/` pools its
anchors, checks its own cap and calls `fetch_books` once, which is what a
`fetch_anchor_books()` on this class used to do for its single caller.

Living below `AppWorkflow` is what puts `Book` and `BookOut` in normal import
reach here.

**One class, bound to `BookRetrievalOutput`.** It was two between 2026-09-07 and
2026-09-08: `count_books` writes fields only `BookRetrievalOutput` has, so a
`BookReaderWorkflow` held `store`/`fetch_books`/`stream_books` — which write to
no output field — under the looser `NodeWorkflowOutput` bound for the generation
node's sake. That node is gone and nothing else produces prose, so the split had
one subclass and came back out. Recover it from git history if a non-retrieval
book node returns.
