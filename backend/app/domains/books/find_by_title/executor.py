"""The title node's flow — the worked example of a **single-call node**.

The 1-1 shape: one request schema, one executor, one LLM call (the arg parse),
then the counts-first opening move — nothing to interpret from upstream, so no
satellite modules. A slice that grows past this (several LLM calls, artifacts
to interpret) graduates to the layout `find_similar_books/` demonstrates; the
reading rule for both is in domains/README.md.
