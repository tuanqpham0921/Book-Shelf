"""Book-domain guide: the specs of every node this domain offers.

One line per node; `Registry` (app/registry.py) answers everything else from
these. To park a node — keep the code, hide it from the planner — drop its SPEC
here: the slice stays importable, but the planner never sees it and
`planjane/executor.py` refuses any goal targeting it. See
docs/design/node-taxonomy-v1.md.
