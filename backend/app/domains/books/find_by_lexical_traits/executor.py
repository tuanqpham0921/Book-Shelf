"""The lexical-traits node's flow — the single-call shape, same as `find_by_title/`.

Parse the goal into lexical traits, build the deferred query, count, preview,
hand the query on. The one thing this node does that the other retrievals don't
is search *text* rather than a column: `BookStore.lexical_query` folds title,
shelf label and description into one tsvector, because `books.categories` holds a
single Google-Books shelf label per book and cannot answer "books about ninjas"
on its own. None of that lives here — the store owns the SQL, and this file owns
the order the steps happen in.
