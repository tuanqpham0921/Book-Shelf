"""Interpret what this node's dependencies handed it — step 1 of the flow.

`SimilarBooksInput.anchors` already did *selection* (by type, in `build_input`);
this is the *interpretation* half the input contract deliberately leaves to the
executor (domains/README.md, executor rule 6): sorting each anchor by what the
node can do with it — rows, or the query that would fetch them — and totalling
how many books that comes to. Nothing here renders prompts or touches the LLM;
that starts in `analyze_references.py`, which reads this module's output.

The total is the reason this module earns its place. Every anchor counted
itself before handing on its query, so the size of the pooled anchor is knowable
without a round trip.

    `SimilarBooksInput.anchors` already selected them, so everything arriving

    The book-shaped branch is gated on `isinstance(BookRetrievalOutput)` rather
    than on a `getattr` for `query`: that is the base of the type
    `SimilarBooksInput.anchors` declares, and it is what makes `num_books` safe
    to read below — a count only means something on an output that promises one.

    *Within* that branch `books` stays duck-typed, and deliberately. Declaring
    rows is a shape claim, not a class, and **no registered node makes it** —
    every output that can reach here hands on a query. NOTE: the pile survives
    only so a test can hand this node reference books with no database
    (`test_parsed_dependents`); delete it when that stops being true.
