"""The similarity node's flow. `run` is the table of contents; everything else
sits where the flow reaches it.

How this slice is laid out (the reading rule):

- **This file is the flow** — `run()` plus every *step* (anything awaited), as
  methods in the order `run` calls them. Pure helpers whose input needs no
  rendering are module-level functions here, also in flow order.
- **A satellite module is one LLM call's pure half** — `analyze_references.py`
  holds the rendering, the tool model and the request builder for the node's
  one LLM call, and nothing that runs.
- **`dependents.py` is step 1's interpretation** — what the node makes of the
  anchors its input contract selected.

The node does one thing: fold the books the user named into a description of
what to look for next, and hand back a query for the pool nearest that
description. It does not rank the pool, drop books from it, or write the reply —
those are a later node's, and none of them exists yet. Handing on the *query*
rather than the rows is what leaves room for them: `Combine_Intersect` can bound
the pool in SQL and cosine order survives the narrowing.

Much of the action is social choreography\u2014dinners, letters, dances, gossip and small humiliations\u2014where unsaid motives and restrained emotion carry more weight than dramatic outbursts. The tone is light, ironic and humane: the narrator gently exposes vanity and prejudice while remaining affectionate toward the characters\u2019 foibles. Conflicts are interpersonal and moral rather than violent, moving the cast toward clearer self-knowledge, humility and the renegotiation of pride and prejudice.
