    `anchors` is required, and both halves of the requirement are the node's

    description of what to look for next, so `list[BookAnchorOutput]` structurally
    refuses a bibliography or a subject search — `build_input` fills by
    `isinstance`, and a plan that tries is skipped at dispatch naming this field
    rather than dying inside the node. **The `min_length`**: `build_input` fills a
    `list[X]` with every match and an empty list is still a *filled* field, so a
    bare `...` would never fire.

    There is no fallback to fall back to. A similarity search with nothing to be
    similar to is a different question — one no registered node answers today.

    No `documents` field: `AnalyzeBooksOutput` is a reserved name with no class,

    `BookConstraints.MIN_SIMILARITY` means the floor never bound and the LIMIT
    chose the whole pool; a `min` well above it means the floor did the cutting
    and the pool is smaller than its ceiling.

    It is also the record `Book.similarity_score` used to keep. Per-book, that
    field only survived as far as the browser, where `BookOut` dropped it; the
    spread reaches `chat_runs` and is what "why these books" is answered from.

class SimilarBooksOutput(BookCandidateOutput):
    """How many books sit nearest the anchor, and the query that reaches them.

    A **candidate** set, and on the candidate side for the same reason every
    other one is: these books match a *description* — the one this node
    synthesized — rather than a reference the user gave. So the pool can never
    be fed back in as an anchor to another similarity search, and a later node
    that re-ranks or picks from it declares `list[BookCandidateOutput]`.

    Shaped like every other retrieval — a count and a query, no rows — which it
    was not until 2026-08-24. `embedding_search_stmt` carries an ORDER BY and a
    LIMIT, and this node used to hand on 50 fetched rows because
    `DeferredBookQuery` forbids both by invariant. It now takes that invariant's
    one documented exception instead, because the rows cost more than the
    exception does: with a query, `Combine_Intersect` bounds the pool in SQL
    and `score` carries cosine order through the narrowing, so a bound on a
    similarity ask is expressible without this node parsing one.

    Counting, intersecting and materializing `query` are all safe — the count
    after an intersect means "of the 250 nearest, N also match". **Pooling it
    with `"or"` is not** — the LIMIT applies before the union, so it changes
    which books qualify, and `compose()` then drops the `score` that chose
    them. Nothing enforces that; see `DeferredBookQuery`. `score` is what
    describes this output, since `num_books` mostly reports the pool size.

    `references` and `search_text` are kept because "why these books" is only
    answerable against what was pointed at and what was embedded. `search_text`
    is the synthesized ideal-book description — what the embedding actually saw
    — not anything the user typed. `references` feeds the reply the node writes;
    `search_text` deliberately does not (see generate_response.py).

    The reply itself is not a field here. It reaches the browser as it is
    written and lands in `chat_runs` on the turn's message trace, which is where
    `run_llm_call` puts every completion — so a field would store it twice.
