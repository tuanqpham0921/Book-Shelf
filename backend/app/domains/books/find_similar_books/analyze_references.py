"""The reference-analysis call's pure half: documents in, request out.

Analyze_Similar_Books searches by vector, not keyword, so everything it depends
on has to collapse into one block of prose reading like the description of the
book the user wants next. `render_documents` builds the document block, and
`build_analysis_request` asks the LLM to fold it into `IdealBookDescription` —
the one string that gets embedded, and now the *only* thing that does. The step
that *runs* the request is `FindSimilarBooksExecutor.analyze_references`, next
door, and it is the slice's one remaining LLM call.

Two things stay out of the prompt. The reference books are excluded from the
search by isbn13 afterwards — a metadata filter, not something to ask prose to
enforce. And the isbn13s never reach the model: the prompt forbids identifiers
in the output, and in a description they only read as noise.
