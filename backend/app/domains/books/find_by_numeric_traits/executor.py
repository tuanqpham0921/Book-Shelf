"""The numeric-traits node's flow — the single-call shape, same as `find_by_author/`.

One request schema, one executor, one LLM call (the arg parse), then the
counts-first opening move: nothing to interpret from upstream, so no satellite
modules — `describe_bounds` and `range_phrase` are pure and sit module-level
beside the flow, the same place `find_by_lexical_traits` keeps
`describe_lexical_traits`. The template and the reading rule are in
domains/README.md.

The one thing this node does that the other retrievals don't is turn words into
numbers — "well rated" into `min_rating: 4.0`. None of that lives here: the
mapping is on `BookMetadataFilter`'s field descriptions, which ship as part of
this node's tool schema, so the parse call is the same shape as every other.
