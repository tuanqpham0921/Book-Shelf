"""What a unit of work is invoked *with* — the typed half of the call.

`RequestContext` answers "what can I reach"; this answers "what am I working
on". A node declares its input as a subclass and lists it on its `NodeSpec`;
`build_input` assembles it from the planner's instruction plus what ran before
it.

The declaration is the point, not the typing. A `dict[str, Any]` can say
something is missing but never *what*; a named, empty field says which slot is
empty and what shape would fill it — the seam an agentic node needs to ask the
planner for one. So default a field whenever the node has a real fallback, and
require it only when the node cannot proceed without it.

Fields are filled by type, never by name — a key in `artifacts` is provenance.

Imports nothing else from `app/domains/`: `base_workflow` imports *it*.
