"""One descriptor per node — the single source `app/registry.py` derives from.

A node is a vertical slice exporting one `SPEC`; the registry derives every
lookup from the collected specs, so adding a capability means adding a folder
and listing its `SPEC`, not editing parallel dicts that can drift apart.

`node_type` is the name the planner LLM emits, and must match the `Literal`
default on the request schema — pydantic's discriminator for picking the class
back out of a tool call. `__post_init__` enforces that; a mismatch would
otherwise only show up as a failed eval.

    Three schemas, distinguished by who fills them in: `request` by the planner
    LLM, `input` by the task runner, `output` by the executor. (`request` and
    `input` converge eventually — the parsed args are an input the node
    currently produces for itself.)

    Args:
        node_type: The capability name the planner emits, e.g. "Retrieve_by_Title".
        tier: Which catalog section this node is listed under.
        request: The pydantic request schema — but what the registry uses it
            for is its *docstring*, which IS the catalog entry the planner
            LLM reads. It lives in the slice's `external.py`. The arguments a
            node needs are not on it: each slice declares an `*Args` model in
            `tools.py` that its own parse call ships, so the planner is given
            a capability to pick rather than fields to guess at. The request
            stays a model because it carries the `node_type` Literal
            everything discriminates on — and so a field the planner really
            should fill has somewhere to go.
        input: What this node is invoked with — declares which upstream shapes
            it can consume. The default accepts the goal text and nothing else,
            which is the right contract for a node with no dependencies.
        output: The result payload the executor fills in.
        executor: The workflow that runs it. None for a node that is registered
            for planning but not yet runnable.
