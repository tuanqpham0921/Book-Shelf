"""`RequestContext` — the services one turn can reach.

Not what a node is working on; that half is `WorkflowInput`. They split on
lifetime: services are built once at the request boundary and are the same for
every node, while an input is assembled fresh at each dispatch.

A node does not read this class directly. Each layer declares the view it needs
as a subclass with a `narrow()` (`BookRequestContext` turns the opaque `stores`
bag into a typed `store`), and `NodeSpec.context` says which view a node wants.
The task runner narrows at dispatch, the first place that knows which node is
about to run.

`stores` stays a type-keyed mapping — the carrier that lets this module hold a
`BookStore` without importing the books domain.
