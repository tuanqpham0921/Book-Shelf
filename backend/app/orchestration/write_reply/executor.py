"""The generation stage's flow. `run` is the table of contents; everything else
sits where the flow reaches it.

Same reading rule as a slice (domains/README.md): this file is the flow —
`run()` plus every step, in the order `run` reaches them — and `render.py` is
the one LLM call's pure half.

**Not a node** (2026-09-08). It was `Generate_Recommendations`, a registered
`NodeTier.GENERATE` slice the planner ended a recommendation chain with; it is
now one unregistered stage the orchestrator runs once, after the task runner,
over everything the plan produced. That is the sink-shaped alternative in
docs/design/execution-pipeline-v1.md, collapsed to a single sink per turn.
Three things follow from it and are why the code below looks the way it does:

- There is no goal, so no planner brief. The user's own message is the brief,
  read off `ctx.user_message` — legitimate here in a way it never was for a
  node, because this is the only stage that answers the *turn*.
- There is no `depends_on`, so nothing pre-selects what it writes about. It
  partitions the whole results map itself, in `_partition`.
- It is planned for every turn, so it can no longer be scoped to
  recommendation asks. A plain lookup now gets prose too, which closes the gap
  named in CLAUDE.md — and costs the golden check that a *planned* generation
  goal gave, since a stage that always runs can never be missing from a plan.

**It no longer fetches** (2026-09-11). Every book node keeps the preview it
streamed on its output, and the runner hands each goal on as a `TaskResult` —
the output plus a summary of what it cost — so the rows the reply names were
fetched where each goal ran. The round trips this stage used to spend are gone,
and with them their cap, which dropped the *last* sources in execution order —
the final answers first. It still subclasses `BookReaderWorkflow`, for
`stream_books`.
