        The third layer of the turn, and the only one that speaks prose. It is
        wired here rather than reached through the registry because it is not a
        capability: no goal targets it, nothing depends on it, and it runs once
        per plan whatever the plan was. That is the same reason `Triage` is a
        workflow in `orchestration/` rather than a node — and it keeps the
        import pointing downward, since `orchestration/` may read `domains/`.

        Returns the workflow so the caller can hang its record on the turn's
        tree, matching how triage and the runner are handled; None when there
        was nothing to write about or nowhere to write from.

        Two ways to decline, both quiet:

        - **No results.** A plan whose every goal was unreachable leaves an
          empty map. There is no evidence to write from, so the stage would
          only invent one — the same failure the `ValueError` in its `run`
          guards against.
        - **No book store on this request.** Narrowing is what a node's
          `NodeSpec.context` did at dispatch; this stage has no spec, so it
          narrows here. A `LookupError` means the services it needs are not on
          this request, which is a deployment problem rather than a turn that
          should die — the cards already streamed, so the user loses the prose
          and nothing else.
