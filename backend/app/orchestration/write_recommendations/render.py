"""The writing call's pure half: the turn's task results in, a request out.

`render_report` turns what the plan produced into the one block of text the
writer reads, and `build_recommendations_request` wraps it. Nothing here runs —
the step that executes the request is
`GenerateRecommendationsExecutor.write_recommendations`, next door.

The rendering is where the writer's whole world is decided. Each section is one
goal's `TaskResult` in three parts: a header (the goal's instruction), an
`<info>` block (how that part of the work ended and how it was done), and a
`<books>` block (the preview the node kept). Two lines are held:

- **No identifiers in the books.** An isbn13 is not something to say in a
  sentence, and a model that sees one will eventually print it, so
  `render_book` never renders one. Each book carries a *handle* instead
  (`1.2`: section 1, book 2) — a label for the reply's `refs`, which
  `books_by_handle` resolves back to the book. The prompt keeps it out of the
  text.
- **Internals are grounding, not vocabulary.** The `<info>` block deliberately
  carries the search arguments, what the goal cost and its SQL (2026-09-11):
  they say exactly what was searched for, which the instruction only
  paraphrases. The prompt tells the model to read them and never repeat them,
  and never to call anything a goal, node or query. Known leak: `compile_sql`
  inlines literals, so a similarity search's SQL carries the anchor ISBNs.
  SQL renders last, so the info cap usually cuts it, and the prompt's
  no-identifiers rule covers the rest. A goal that crashed adds its exception's
  message — the message only, never the type name or traceback — and the prompt
  turns it into a plain cause ("that isn't something I can do yet").

The report is evidence and nothing else. It used to open with a `What to write:`
brief — this stage's own goal instruction, the one line in the block the model
was told to obey — and that line went away with the goal (2026-09-08): an
unregistered stage has no planner text, so the *user's* message is the brief and
it travels as the `UserMessage` in `build_recommendations_request`.

**Each section is capped, not the report.** Truncating the joined block cut
from the end, and the end is where failures render. A section is bounded by its
parts — the instruction (`MAX_INSTRUCTION_LENGTH`), one `MAX_INFO_CHARS` block
and at most `BookConstraints.default_limit` books of `MAX_BOOK_CHARS` each — and
a plan by `MAX_SYSTEM_GOALS`, so the report needs no cap of its own.

One typed read reaches into a sibling slice: a source that is a
`SimilarBooksOutput` carries the anchor books it was built from and the
description it embedded, which are the actual "why these fit" material.
Interpretation of upstream shapes is the consuming stage's own job (rule 4 in
domains/README.md), and widening `BookCandidateOutput` so this stays
import-free would put two fields on a shared shape for one reader.
